# Performance Evaluation (labs)

This repository contains the code skeletons for each lab. Check out our
[open courseware](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/ep) for access to the full
materials.

## Organization

Each lab should have a subdirectory under `content/`, bearing a suggestive
name (e.g. `cpu/`, or `network/`). In the repository root, symlinks named
`lab_${NUM}` will contain relative addresses to these subdirectories, in
case the lab order will change again at some point.

For each lab, organize task materials in subdirectories named `task_${NUM}`.
Make sure that `${NUM}` is padded with 0 up to two digits for both task
directories and lab symlinks (e.g., `lab_01`, `task_02`).
